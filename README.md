# Sudoku Solver

## How to Run:

> ### Environment
> * Programming Language: Python
> * Python Version (of my python): 3.8.2

> ### Steps
1. do &nbsp;&nbsp; **`pip install pipenv`**
2. **Download** or **Clone** repo
3. **cd** into downloaded/cloned folder
_once in directory_
4. do &nbsp;&nbsp; **`pipenv install`** &nbsp; to install required packages (in a virtual environment) `*1`
5. do &nbsp;&nbsp; **`pipenv shell`** &nbsp; to activate the virtual environment `*1`
6. do &nbsp;&nbsp; **`python sudoku.py`** &nbsp; to run the program `*2`



#### *Notes*
* `*1` -> if u prefer global packages, just install pygame globally
* `*2` -> you can edit:
    * TICK_RATE -> faster/slower processing of the solver
    * sudoku -> change the game string, found the sudoku games as string [HERE](https://www.kaggle.com/bryanpark/sudoku)
    * colors i guess? lmao
